This online utility fills a text file with random characters until it reaches a certain size. You can specify the size in the file length option (above) and you can enter characters that will go in the file in the second options column. For your convenience, we've listed the most often used character types in the dropdown. They are â€“ lower case chars, upper case chars, mixed case chars, and digits. Hit the save as button to download the file you generated. Filabulous!
